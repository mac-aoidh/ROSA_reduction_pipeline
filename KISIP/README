KISIP Package.

Please note that the code contained within the KISIP section of this repository is not actually my code. The authors are F. Woger, O. von der Luhe and K. Reardon.

The original source for this was: https://forge.kis.uni-freiburg.de/kisip/
However, that source appears to be down, so I have included this with the ROSA reduction piepline as it is used by the pipeline to speckle the data.

The paper related to this code is: Woger, F., von der Luhe, O., & Reardon, K., 2008, A&A, 488, 375 titled "Speckle interferometry with adaptive optics corrected solar data".

As stated I have included this code here as the original source is gone and this is essential for Speckling ROSA data. 
I may not be much help for you if you have issues setting this code up or troubleshooting while you are using it (so keep that in mind).
Also, this code is set up to work on my system. As such some codes in this directory are perhaps uneccessary for you or may not be needed.
For example, our cluster utilises the slurm queue manager, which you may not. Therefore, the slurm files may not be useful. I have included them in case they are.
Also, sgX refers to partitions within our cluster for queuing speckle runs (they are probably not needed for you).

There is a manual within the /notes/ folder to help you get set up.
